	    <h2>Gschool @ Galvanize</h2>
	    <p>I have enrolled in an intensive web development course linked to galvanize.  This six month program aims to teach 25 students the ins-and-outs of Ruby on Rails and Javascript coding.  We also get to dabble with HTML and CSS.</p>

	    <h2>Code Retreats</h2>
	    <p>On some Fridays, we escape the confines of the Galvanize space and head to various places throughout the city to focus on coding and partner pairing.  We work on various projects that make us </p>

	    <h2>Ruby Conference</h2>
	    <p>Students get exposed to various people and form of coding.  We attended the Rocky Mountain Ruby Conference.  This conference elaborated on testing and gems. </p>

	    <p>This checks the models for validity and initializes all properties associated with relationships. It is likely if you use a web-framework such as merb or rails, this will already be done for you. In case you do not, be sure to call it at an appropriate time. DataMapper allows the use of natural primary keys, composite primary keys and other complexities. </p>

	    <p>Practice makes perfect.  It takes a lot of time to understand the content that we use.  Working at home, where there is peace and quiet allows us to comprehend information more comprehensively. </p>

	    <h2>More Events</h2>
	    <p>Categories can have many Posts and Posts can have many Categories, so we’ll need a many to many relationship commonly referred to “has and belongs to many”. We’ll setup a quick model to wrap our join table between the two so that we can record a little bit of meta-data about when the post was categorized into a category.</p>

	    <h2>More Information</h2>
	    <p>The above example is simplified, but you can also specify more options such as constraints for your properties. DataMapper supports a lot of different property types natively, and more through dm-types. An important thing to note is that every model must have a key in order to be valid. If a model has no key, there's no way to identify a resource and thus no way to update its persistent state within the backend datastore. </p>

	  <section id ='more-content'>
	    <h2>More Content</h2>
	    <p>DataMapper is intended to have a lean and minimalistic core, which provides the minimum necessary features for an ORM. It's also designed to be easily extensible, so that everything you want in an ORM can be added in with a minimum of fuss. It does this through plugins, which provide everything from automatically updated timestamps to factories for generating DataMapper resources.</p>
